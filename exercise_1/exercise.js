Write a function named rightJustify that takes a string named s as a parameter 
and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.
Hint: Use string concatenation and loop. Also, string has a property called length.
Ex:
>rightJustify('monty')
                                                                monty

/*
Fermat’s Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers a, b, and c such that
a^n + b^n = c^n 
for any values of n greater than 2.
Write a function named checkFermat that takes four parameters— a, b, c and n—and checks to see if Fermat’s theorem holds. 
If n is greater than 2 and
a^n + b^n = c^n
the program should print, “Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!” Otherwise the program should print, “No, that doesn’t work.”

The purpose of this exercise is to take a problem and break it into smaller problems, and to solve the smaller problems by writing simple functions.
Consider the first verse of the song “99 Bottles of water:

99 bottles of water on the wall,
99 bottles of water,
ya’ take one down, ya’ pass it around,
98 bottles of water on the wall.

Subsequent verses are identical except that the number of bottles gets smaller by one in each verse, until the last verse:

No bottles of water on the wall,
no bottles of water,
ya’ can’t take one down, ya’ can’t pass it around,
’cause there are no more bottles of water on the wall!


And then the song (finally) ends.

/*.
Write a recursive function named oddSum that takes a positive odd integer n and 
returns the sum of odd integers from 1 to n. Start with a base case, 
and use temporary variables to debug your solution. 
You might find it helpful to print the value of n each time oddSum is invoked.

/*
Write a recursive function called power that takes a number x and an integer n and returns x^n.

Hint: A recursive definition of this operation is x^n = x · x^(n−1). Also, remember that anything raised to the zeroth power is 1.

Optional challenge: you can make this method more efficient, when n is even, using x^n = (x^(n/2))^2.
